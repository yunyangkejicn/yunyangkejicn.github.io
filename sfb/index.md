# Smart Floating Ball Privacy Policy

Smart Floating Ball ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information collected when you use the Smart Floating Ball mobile application ("Smart Floating Ball" or "the App"). Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices. By using Smart Floating Ball, you accept and agree to the practices described in this policy.

## Information We Collect and How We Use It

Smart Floating Ball is designed to prioritize your privacy. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data from you on our servers. All personal information generated by or entered into the app is stored directly on your device.

To enable certain features, the Application may need to transmit some of your data to an AI large model provider. This data may include, but is not limited to, the current page content and the URL of the current webpage you are using. The Application also calls the provider's APIs to enable these features. The use and processing of this data will be subject to the provider's privacy policy.

Apart from the data transmitted to the provider for the purpose of enabling specific features, all other private data remains on your device.

The only information we may collect is technical data for diagnostic purposes to improve the app's performance and stability. This may include crash reports and usage analytics, which are collected in an anonymized form so they cannot be linked back to you. We may use third-party services like Google's Firebase Analytics for this purpose.

## Your Data Stays on Your Device

All of your personal information, including any data you enter or create within the app, is stored locally on your device. This means:

We do not have access to your data. We cannot view, access, or use any of the information you store in Smart Floating Ball.

Your data is not synced to a server. There is no "Cloud" or similar service that backs up your data. If you uninstall the app or get a new device, your data will be lost unless you back it up yourself.

Your data is not sold or rented to anyone. Since we do not collect your data, we cannot share it.

## Your Control Over Your Data

Because your data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it. You can delete or manage any information you've entered at any time directly within the Smart Floating Ball app.

## Third-Party Services and Links

Smart Floating Ball may include links to third-party websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

Any changes we make to this privacy policy in the future will be communicated to you within the Smart Floating Ball application.
